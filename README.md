# Coffee_sales_project

In this project I use Excel and SQL to make various functions that query through an imported dataset of coffee sales data in New York

I Build multiple Pivot tables as well as search through this dataset to make aggregations, spot trends, and determine which store products are perfomring bettter and propose questions as to why this could be through SQL.

I utilize simple select statements, CTE's, window partitions, sub query's and other aggregation features to help explore and answer these questions clearly.
