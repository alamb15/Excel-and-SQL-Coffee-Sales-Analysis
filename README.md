# Coffee_sales_project

In this project I use SQL, Excel, and finally Tableau to make various functions that query through an imported dataset of coffee sales data in New York

I Build multiple Pivot tables as well as search through this dataset to make aggregations, spot trends, and determine which store product categories are perfomring bettter and propose questions as to why this could be.

I utilize simple select statements, CTE's, window partitions, sub query's and other aggregation features to help explore and answer these questions clearly and through tableau discovered that Coffee and Tea are purchased more than all other product categoriues combined across all locations.
