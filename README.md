# SQL_Coffee_sales_project

In this SQL project I use various intermediate and advanced SQL functions to query through an imported dataset of coffee sales data in New York

I search through this dataset to make aggregations, spot trends, and determine which store products are perfomring bettter and propose questions as to why this could be.

I utilize simple select statements, CTE's, window partitions, sub query's and other aggregation features to help explore and answer these questions clearly.
